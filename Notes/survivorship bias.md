Survivorship [[bias]] is a sort of a [[logical fallacy]] or logical error of focusing on individuals or things that are inherently selective in nature in a way that it misrepresents the actual data due to the selection process
This bias causes you to view situations and others in a much more skewed way as anyone who doesnt clear the selection processes would look to you as not doing the right things even while putting similar efforts as the other person
